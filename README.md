# Diabetes prediction


# Project objectives

1. Explore and apply SHAPRFECV for features reduction
2. Compare models performance with reduced and full features for 3 models LightGBM, Logistic and Random Forest
   We want to predict the likelihood of readmission of diabete patient after being discharged from a hospital

# About dataset

This dataset published by University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This contains patient information who has diabetes status, the drugs were prescripted, patient demographic information, etc...
